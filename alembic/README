Upgrade to the latest version of the database through the following 
steps:

* Open a terminal in the root folder for this project
* Activate your environment
* Run `alembic upgrade head`

Alembic will run the upgrade scripts from the alembic\versions folder.

To create a new upgrade script after changing the model run
`alembic revision --autogenerate -m "initialise database"`

Check the file that was generated to make sure that the changes
are in line with what you expected. If there are more complex
data migrations (e.g. copying data from one table to another) you
can add these by hand.
